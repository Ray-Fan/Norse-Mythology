## The world before the death of Ymir: chaotic universe

### Geography

The universe/world is just a chaos. 

_In the middle_: **Ginunga**, `a huge chasm` separating two lands.

_On the north_: **Niflheim**, `the land of ice and fog`. On this land, there is a spring, **Hvergelmir** (`bubbling boiling spring`), from which many rivers originate. One of the rivers is highly poisonous.

> Heim in German means home.

_On the south_: **Muspelheim**, `the land of fire`. It is guarded by the giant **Surt**. 

### Formation of life: Giants & Gods

The giant Surt has a flaming sword. When he wields the sword, the sparks fall on the Ginunga and the ice melts, which generates lives: 
* **Ymir**, `the ancestor of all giants`
* **Audhumbla**, `a giant cow`. 
* _Ymir lives on the milk of Audhumbla and Audhumbla licks the ice of Niflheim._

Ymir gives birth to **12 giants**, _in an unknown process_.

As Audhumbla licks the ice, **Búri** _is licked free from the salty ice_, Buri is `the ancestor of all the gods`. Buri then gives birth 
to `his son` **Bor**, _in an unknown process_, lol.

### War between giants and gods

`Giants are affected by the poisonous river and become cruel and evil. Buri represents justice`. Therefore, a big war is launched 
between them and ended with giants’ victory.

_Bor marries one the giants_ and gives birth to *Odin, Vili and Ve*, `the three most important gods`.

_Odin, Vili and Ve killed Ymir and almost all the giants_. Only two giants, one male and one female, survived and fled to **Jotunheim**, 
`the Kingdom of Giants`.

## The death of Ymir: gods building the world

_The three gods, Odin, Vili and Vé, use **the body of Ymir** to build the world_:

* his flesh -> the earth 
* his blood -> the ocean
* his bones -> the mountains
* his hairs -> the trees
* this brain -> the could 
* this skull -> the heavens
* his elbow -> **Midgard**, `where human lives`. `It is between Niflheim and Muspelheim`.

Odin takes `the sparks from Muspelheim` and use them to _create the sun, moon and stars_, then we the distinction between day and night. 
Thus we have time.

They made their own home, **Asgard**, `with gold and silver`.

They also create **human**: `ask -> man; embla -> woman`.

Ymir’s corpse began to rot. `The maggots grow on his corpse` become **dwarfs** and **elves**.

## The world after Ymir’s death: Yggdrasil

`A giant tree, which connects the earth and the sky`. It becomes the whole world after the death of Ymir. Its flourishment and death is related to the fate of the world.

### Three Primary Roots

Yggdrasil is supported by three giant primary roots:

* `_The first one_ connects Asgard` and has an important spring, **Urdarbrunnr**(`the well of Urda, Urd means fate`) besides. There live three norns (goddess), `representing past, present and future`.

* `_The second one_ connect Jotunheim` and has a spring, **Mímisbrunnr** (`“Mimir’s well”, “Mimir” means “wisdom”`).

* `_The third one_ connect Niflheim`. There is an important spring, **Hvergelmir** (`"bubbling boiling spring”`), which is the source of 
numerous rivers.

### Three Main Creatures

Apart from the gods, human and other guys mentioned above, there are also three other main beings living on Yggdrasil:

* `A dragon`, **Nidhogg**, lives at the third primary root, who gnaws at the root of Yggdrasil. When he bits through the roots, 
**Ragnarök** (`"the twilight of the gods"`) will come.

* `An eagle` lives at the top of Yggdrasil. **Vedfolnir**, `a hawk sits between the eagles’ eyes`.

* `A squirrel`, **Ratatoskr**, who runs up and down on Yggdrasil and carries messages between the eagle and dragon.

* There are also four elks, which also eats the leaves of Yggdrasil.

## The Nine Worlds on Yggdrasil

1. **Asgard** - World of the Asen (gods).
2. **Vanaheim** - World of Wanen (also Vanen, the "shining ones"), older deities, above all gods of fertility and agriculture.
3. **Ljossalfheim** - World of Light Albums (Elves)
4. **Midgard** - middle world, place of residence of the people
5. **Jötunheim** - World of Giants
6. **Niflheim** - the land of ice and fog.
7. **Muspelheim** - the land of fire.
8. **Svartalfheim** - World of Black Albums (Dwarfs)
9. **Helheim** - the hell, where the soul goes.

As for how these nine worlds are arranged on the Yggdrasil, there are many different models. Below is one of the models that fits the
descriptions above:
