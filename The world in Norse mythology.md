# The Formation of the World in Norse Mythology

## The world before the death of Ymir: chaotic universe

The universe/world is just a chaos. There is just a huge chasm: Ginunga. 

On the north of it, it is Niflheim, the land of ice and fog. On this land, there is a spring, from which many rivers originate. 
One of the rivers is highly poisonous.

On the south of it, it is Muspelheim, the land of fire. It is guarded by the giant Sur. He has a flaming sword. When he wields 
the sword, the sparks fall on the Ginunga and the ice melts, which generates lives: Ymir, the ancestor of all giants, and  
Audhumbla, a giant cow. Ymir lives on the milk of Audhumbla and Audhumbla licks the ice of Niflheim.

Ymir gives birth to 12 giants, in an unknown process.

As Audhumbla licks the ice, Búri is licked free from the salty ice, Buri is the ancestor of all the gods. Buri then gives birth 
to his son Bor, in an unknown process, lol.

Giants are affected by the poisonous river and become cruel and evil. Buri represents justice. Therefore, a big war is launched 
between them and ended with giants’ victory.

Bor marries one the giants and gives birth to Odin, Vili and Ve.

## The death of Ymir: gods building the world

Odin, Vili and Ve killed Ymir and almost all the giants. Only two giants, one male and one female, survived and fled to Jotunheim, 
the Kingdom of Giants.

The three gods, Odin, Vili and Vé, use the body of Ymir to build the world:

his flesh -> the earth; his blood -> the ocean
his bones -> the mountains
his hairs -> the trees
this brain -> the could;  this skull -> the heavens
his elbow -> Midgard, where human lives. It is between Niflheim and Muspelheim.

Odin takes the sparks from Muspelheim and use them to create the sun, moon and stars, then we the distinction between day and night. 
Thus we have time.

They made their own home, Asgard, with gold and silver.

They also create human: ask -> man; embla -> woman.

Ymir’s corpse began to rot. The maggots grow on his corpse become dwarfs and elves.

## The world after Ymir’s death: Yggdrasil

A giant tree, which connects the earth and the sky. It becomes the whole world after the death of Ymir.

Yggdrasil has three giant primary roots :

The first one connects Asgard and has Urdarbrunnr(the well of Urda, Urd means fate) besides. There live three norns (goddess): 
past, present, future.

The second one connect Jotunheim and has a spring, Mímisbrunnr (“Mimir’s well”, “Mimir” means “wisdom”).

The third one connect Niflheim. There is an important spring, Hvergelmir ("bubbling boiling spring”), which is the source of 
numerous rivers.

There are three main creatures living on the Yggdrasil:

A dragon, Nidhogg, lives at the third primary root, who gnaws at the root of Yggdrasil. When he bits through the roots, 
Ragnarök ("the twilight of the gods") will come.

An eagle lives at the top of Yggdrasil. Vedfolnir, a hawk sits between the eagles’ eyes.

A squirrel, Ratatoskr, who runs up and down on Yggdrasil and carries messages between the eagle and dragon.
